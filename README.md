# Book Reviews

I love reading books (tech and non-tech), and this has increased in the recent past. I have a habit of taking notes as I read a book. I tried using note-taking applications like Logseq and Notion. However, I came back to classic pen and paper. This repository will collect distilled digital forms of those notes, like book reviews.
